TODO - Version 2
================

Support field labels in data constructors

  Remember that the same field label can be used for multiple data constructors
  under a type, even in different positions, but must produce a single binding.

Compile the basic libraries rather than writing them manually in JS, except IO

TODO - Version 3
================

Generate one JS file per module

  Also generate an HTML file per main program which includes all necessary JS

  Run the main program on load

  Include natives.js in the HTML

Add lots of native libraries

Add a check somewhere to make sure that Main.main exists and is the right type

Make it possible to run the standard optimization passes
