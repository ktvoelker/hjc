====

Fix the call to main: it is currently not qualified with a module name

Make sure that a module's object is created before adding its bindings

Implement enough of IO so that a program can produce output

Support field labels in data constructors

  Remember that the same field label can be used for multiple data constructors
  under a type, even in different positions, but must produce a single binding.

Add lots of native libraries

Add a check somewhere to make sure that Main.main exists and is the right type
